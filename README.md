# Thiefd, Functions-as-a-Service in Lua with Podman

This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running THIEFD, an open-source function-as-a-service framework written in Lua, using Podman instead of Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu-based system (for apt-get commands)
- Sudo access
- Podman installed and configured

## Installation Steps

1. Install Lua and required system dependencies:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y lua5.3 liblua5.3-dev luarocks build-essential libssl-dev
   ```

2. Install Lua dependencies using LuaRocks:
   ```
   sudo luarocks install luasocket
   sudo luarocks install luasec
   sudo luarocks install lanes
   sudo luarocks install luafilesystem
   ```

3. Install Certbot for SSL certificate management:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y certbot
   ```

4. Set up the required environment variables:
   ```
   export THIEFD_FORWARD_MODE=false
   export THIEFD_PODMAN_IMAGE="your-podman-image-name"
   export THIEFD_API_USERNAME="your-api-username"
   export THIEFD_API_PASSWORD="your-api-password"
   export THIEFD_SERVER_PORT=443
   export THIEFD_DOMAIN="your-domain.com"
   export THIEFD_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
   export THIEFD_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT="/thiefd"  # Optional: Set custom endpoint
   ```
   Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

   Optional: If you want to use forward mode, also set:
   ```
   export THIEFD_FORWARD_MODE=true
   export THIEFD_FORWARD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-webhook-url.com"
   ```

5. Save the Lua script to a file named `thiefd.lua`.

## Running the Script

1. Make sure you have root privileges to bind to port 443:
   ```
   sudo -E lua thiefd.lua
   ```
   The `-E` flag ensures that your environment variables are passed to the sudo environment.

2. The script will automatically attempt to obtain or renew a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for your domain.

3. Once running, the server will listen for HTTPS requests on the specified port (default 443).

## Usage

Send POST requests to `https://your-domain.com{CUSTOM_ENDPOINT}` with the following:
- Basic Authentication using the API username and password
- Request body containing the Podman command to execute

Example using curl:
```
curl -X POST -u "your-api-username:your-api-password" \
     -d "your podman command here" \
     https://your-domain.com/thiefd
```

Note: Replace `/thiefd` with your custom endpoint if you've set the `THIEFD_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

## Custom Endpoint

You can set a custom endpoint for your THIEFD server:

1. Set the `THIEFD_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT` environment variable before running the script:
   ```
   export THIEFD_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT="/your-custom-endpoint"
   ```

2. If not set, the default endpoint `/thiefd` will be used.

3. Use your custom endpoint when sending requests to the server.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure your server is properly secured, as this script allows remote execution of Podman commands.
- Use strong, unique credentials for the API username and password.
- Regularly update and patch your system and all dependencies.
- Monitor logs and access to the server.
- Choose a non-obvious custom endpoint to add an extra layer of security.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues, ensure you're running the script with appropriate privileges.
- Check that all required environment variables are correctly set.
- Verify that your domain's DNS is properly configured to point to your server's IP address.
- Ensure that port 443 is open and accessible from the internet.
- If you're using a custom endpoint and can't connect, double-check that you're using the correct endpoint in your requests.
- If Podman commands fail, ensure that Podman is properly installed and configured on your system.
